# `ledswarm_enclosure`

A custom 3D-printed enclosure for LEDswarm controllers, made to be printed out of resin in SLA printers.

This fulfills a similar role as the original bottle blanks used to enclose the electronics of Ghoust controllers, but it has been adapted to support mounting circuit boards and diffusor pipes in a solid plastic case which holds everything in place, especially regarding the USB-C board-to-board connection between the mainboard and the LED board.

## Features

- Lengthwise PCB slot for a mainboard with board edge (straddle mount) USB-C plug
- Water-tight sealing using flanges with o-rings
- Top surface within the diffusor flange to mount the LED peripheral board with M1.7 screws
- Ceiling projection using a plano-convex lens which is integrated into the top cover
